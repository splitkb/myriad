# Vendor IDs

Vendor IDs allow each designer to give their cards a unique identifier without risking an accidental ID collision.

If you wish to make your Myriad products publicly available, you should [register a Vendor ID](https://github.com/splitkb/myriad/issues/new?assignees=&labels=vid-request&projects=&template=vid_request.yml&title=%5BVID%5D%3A+) - it's free!

{: .note }
You don't need to register a Vendor ID for personal use - you can just use the reserved VID `FFFF` for your prototypes or personal projects.

| Value | Name | URL |
|-------|------|-----|

| `0001` | splitkb.com | [https://splitkb.com](https://splitkb.com) |
| `FFFF` | *Reserved* | Used for DIY cards which are not commercially available |
