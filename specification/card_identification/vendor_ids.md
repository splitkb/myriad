# Vendor IDs

Vendor IDs allow each designer to give their cards a unique identifier without risking an accidental ID collision. If you wish to make your Myriad products publicly available, you should register (TODO LINK PR TEMPLATE) a Vendor ID - it's free!

{: .note }
You don't need to register a Vendor ID for personal use - you can just use the reserved VID `FFFF` for your prototypes or personal projects.
