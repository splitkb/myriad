# Card Identification
Myriad uses EEPROM chips placed on the card to allow identification of the card inserted. This allows the keyboard to automatically configure the card for use, allowing for a seamless no-code experience.

# EEPROM Selection and Addressing
The Myriad ecosystem use standard 2kb-16kb IÂ²C EEPROM chips, such as the [Zetta ZD24C16A](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2109141830_Zetta-ZD24C08A-STGMT_C2896640.pdf). They use the address range `1010 000X` - `1010 111X`.

The EEPROM chips use 2kb pages, with the 3 LSBs of the device address used for page selection. If no page selection is possible, the relevant bit is set to 0. This means a 2kb EEPROM chip will *always* use address `1010 000X`, but a 16kb chip will use the entire `1010 000X` - `1010 111X` range.

Write protection is allowed, but not mandatory.

# Header

| Length | Format | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 3 | 0x`4D 59 52` | [Magic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)), ASCII characters `MYR`.
| 3 | uint8 `major`, uint8 `minor`, uint8 `patch` | [Version number](versioning.html), currently `01 00 00`.
| 4 | uint32 | Payload Checksum. [Adler-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler-32) checksum of the entire payload.
| 2 | uint16 | Payload length in bytes.
| n | -      | Payload, consists of one or more [entries](#payload-entries).

# Payload entries
Payload entries follow the following format:

| Length | Format | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | uint8 | Entry type identifier.
| 1 | uint8 | Data length in bytes.
| n | - | Data, format depends on entry type.

Note that this allows the reader to trivially skip unsupported entry types. Payload entries may appear in any order. Some payload entry types may be repeated.

# Payload Entry Types
Note that new entry types may be added from time to time in order to support additional functionality.

## Metadata
### Card Identifier
*Mandatory: No. Repeatable: No. Since: 1.0.0.*

{: .warning }
This entry **must** be present!

*Mandatory: No. Repeatable: No. Since: 1.0.0.*

| Length | Format | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `0x04` | Entry type identifier.
| 1 | `n` | Data length in bytes.
| n | utf-8 | Product URL String.
