# Physical Dimensions

Myriad cards use the M.2 form factor, also known as "NGFF". It is commonly used by NVMe SSDs and Wifi cards. This means that the [M.2 specification](/assets/pdf/m2_spec.pdf) serves as the basis for the Myriad specification.

This page describes the physical dimensions required to create a Myriad-compatible card. You can also use one of our [footprints](/design.html#resources) if you want to save yourself some trouble.

{: .warning }
Make sure you order your cards with a thickness of 0.80mm!

## Keying
Myriad cards, like all other M.2 cards, have a physical "notch" preventing the insertion of incompatible cards. Myriad cards use **Key A**. This means pins 8-15 are missing. Pins 24-31 (Key E) are [kept reserved](electrical.html#reserved-pins) for potential future use.

## Card edge
In order to allow insertion, the card must be 0.80mm (Â± 0.08mm) thick. ENIG finish is strongly recommended for durability. Contrary to the M.2 specification, a card edge bevel is not required.

For card edge pads and cutout dimensions, please see Figure 16 through 18 of the [M.2 specification](/assets/pdf/m2_spec.pdf) (pages 39-41). We recommend using our pre-existing [footprints](design.html#resources) to avoid having to manually copy this.

## Card dimensions
![Card dimensions](/assets/images/card_dimensions.png)

We define a set of standard card sizes to make it easier to determine whether a card will fit a specific keyboard.

The following sizes are defined:

| *Size codes* | **22mm wide** | **30mm wide** | **> 30mm wide** |
| **22mm tall** | SS | SM | SL |
| **30mm tall** | MS | MM | ML |
| **> 30mm tall** | LS | LM | LL |

Cards which are Small or Medium in either width or height will always fit into a keyboard matching that size. Cards which have one or more Large dimensions are *not* guaranteed to fit - the card maker should publish exact dimensions and compatibility with the most common keyboards.

If physically possible, the size code should be marked LINK on the card itself.

{: .note }
Card height includes the 4mm needed for the connector.

## Standoff
The card is secured using a standoff and regular M2.5 screw. If the keyboard supports cards of length S (22mm) or larger, a standoff will be present at 22mm. If the keyboard supports cards of length M (30mm) or larger, a second standoff will be present at 30mm.

The card must have a circular cutout at either y=22mm or y=30mm with a diameter of 2.7mm (radius 1.35mm), surrounded by a plated pad with a diameter of 5.4mm (radius 2.7mm). On most cards, this will result in a half-circle due to the card's length.

## Keepout areas
In order to avoid interfering with the socket, do not place any components:
- Within 4.0mm of the connector card edge on the frontside.
- Within 5.2mm of the connector card edge on the backside.

Within a 3.5mm radius of (x=0mm, y=30mm) on the backside, do not place any components n order to avoid interfering with the 30mm standoff. Placing signal or power traces in this area is **strongly** discouraged, but a ground plane is fine.

## Vertical spacing
![Card height](/assets/images/card_height.png)

Components on the **bottom** of the cards must be at most **1.40mm** tall, leaving 0.90mm for components placed on the keyboard. Component height on the **top** is unrestricted, provided they remain within the card boundaries.

{: .note }
Keyboards may use connectors shorter than 4.20mm - but that makes finding standoffs a lot trickier.

## Mounting Hardware
If you are designing your own keyboard, we recommend the TE Connectivity [2199230-8](https://octopart.com/2199230-8-te+connectivity-46436158) ([datasheet](/assets/pdf/socket_datasheet.pdf)) connector  and Wurth Elektronik [9774025151R](https://octopart.com/9774025151r-wurth+elektronik-59774856) ([datasheet](/assets/pdf/standoff_datasheet.pdf)) standoffs, but any compatible ones will do.

Footprints are provided in our [repository](design.html#resources).
